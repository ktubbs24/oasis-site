## Benefits of using ChatGPT

1. I don't have to pay for different types of writing apps that would not cost too much short term, but why pay when I can have it integrated within Obsidian or using Bing ChatGPT Free
2. It's already going to be integrated with my notes and all of my writing entries.
3. You can help me with proofreading, my work, or give me a rough outline of long drives that don't have a break in paragraphs that I will be trying to draft to publish.
4. I can ask ChatGPT to find hard-to-read sentences that I would have in a draft, for example, I have a lot of times right without commas or periods as soon as that may even be as long as one paragraph.
5. Can ask it questions that are helpful for when I need a scripture verse but don't want to waste time looking it up online.
6. Could ask it to summarize my published draft to have an excerpt for me 
7. Summarize articles or videos for me to draw out the main points‚Ä¶extremely valuable to get the main points discussed from my published videos to be able to write a quick article to them (I'm still not interested in chat not doing this for me)
8. Can ask it to translate articles and essays or video descriptions for me when I plan on making video content for other countries. **WordPress** has many plug-ins that do this for me for the entire site in all languages if I want so no need to do this for individual posts
9. Can ask ChatGPT for relatable notes and writing entries for me which helps with connecting published posts in the WordPress editor and this would be great when connected to plug-ins in WordPress that automatically link blog posts for me
10. The smart connection's plugin can also be extremely helpful for finding topics already written in my older obsidian vaults and all notes related to one that I'm asking to search for without relying on obsidian search.

##  What I don't need it for 
1. I don't need help to write anything. I get that from the Holy Spirit and I have a whole backlog of thousands of entries that need to be published, so using ChatGPT just helps with being efficient but not helping me with doing my work for me.
2. I don't need to write an initial outline if I have an idea but don't know how to write the idea or flesh it out.
