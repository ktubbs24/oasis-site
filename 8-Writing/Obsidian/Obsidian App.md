## How I like to use Obsidian 

### Workflows

- Using my [[[3] Notes/2-Nexus Notes/Topics/Note-Taking/i.R.E.S.T.]] writing system for blogging in [[Bear App]] and for use in the [[Obsidian App]] for gardening when I make notes during studying sessions of different topics. 
- Using my [[i.H.I.T.]] archiving system for putting my notes, essays, poems, stories, etc away for easier retrieval when needed at a later date. 
- [[Using Obsidian with Chat Gpt]] for when I may want to research and find certain things that I am studying without having to search for sources online or for revising my drafts for me, similar to using [Grammarly]([https://www.grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/) or [The Language Tool]([https://languagetool.org](https://languagetool.org/)).

## Favorite Tools That Works With Obsidian 

**Quick Capture**
- [Fleeting Notes]([https://www.fleetingnotes.app](https://www.fleetingnotes.app/)) - A great external way to quick capture ideas or notes to my Obsidan app. It syncs with Obsidian so I could make a note for something that would be able to sync with the notes *within* Obsidian. 

**Web Clippers**
- [Markdownload web clipper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) Can be used to download any markdown text from a website but it works great with Obsidian.
