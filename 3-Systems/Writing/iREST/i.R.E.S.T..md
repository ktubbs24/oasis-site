# i.R.E.S.T.
Related: [[i.H.I.T.]]

i.R.E.S.T. Is an acronym that I made to help with me with remembering the different steps or phases of writing, when I am doing longform writing whenever Iâ€™m writing essays or blogs. I use what I call [[[6] Notes/[1] Nexus/[3] Themes/Writing/wikiblogging]] while writing. 

This is also the acronym that I refer back to when Iâ€™m doing [[Note-Taking]] and [[notemaking]]. 

- [[i stands for idea]] 
- [[R stands for reflection]] 
- [[E stands for emerge]] 
- [[S stands for Summarization]] 
- [[T stands for Topic]]
